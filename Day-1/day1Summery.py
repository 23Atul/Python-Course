# Day 1: Summary(Python Basics)

# VS Code Setup: Installed Python extension, ran Python scripts.

    # Variables: Store values(e.g., x=10, name="Alice").
    # Data Types: int, float, str, bool, None.

    # Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3].
    # Access elements via index: my_list[0].

# Tuples:
    # Immutable, created with ().
    # Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3).
